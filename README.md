# Discord User API

This is a svelte app that uses an **Discord User API** to get user information, in this case I demonstrate it using my own user id.

### API URL

    https://lanyard.rest/v1/users/:userid

To use this you need to be in a specific discord server for them to be able to get the information. Here is the discord server link:
